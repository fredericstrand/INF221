    "## 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "### There is no such thing as a free lunch (for the last 20 years ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Free Lunch is Over](Figures/Sutter_CPU.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From [The Free Lunch Is Over by Herb Sutter](http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clock speeds do not grow any more\n",
    "    - Essentially limited by energy consumption\n",
    "    - Heat cannot be moved from chip efficiently enough\n",
    "- Memory is limited (by physics)\n",
    "    - Typical clock frequency 2 GHz $\\Longrightarrow$ cycle time 0.5 ns \n",
    "    - Speed of light: $300\\,000$ km/s\n",
    "    - $0.5 \\text{ns} \\times 300\\,000 \\text{km}/\\text{s} = 5\\cdot 10^{-10} \\text{s}\\times 3\\cdot 10^8 \\text{m}/\\text{s} = 15 \\text{cm}$\n",
    "    - Electrical signals on circuit boards travel at most at half the speed of light in vacuum\n",
    "    - Signals travel only about 10 cm during a single clock cycle\n",
    "    - Fast memory must be *very close* to the CPU\n",
    "- We need **smart algorithms** and **efficient data structures**\n",
    "- Algorithms and data structures are **essential computing technologies**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this course is about\n",
    "- Key algorithms for e.g., sorting and searching\n",
    "- Essential data structures such as lists and trees\n",
    "- Proving the **correctness** of algorithms\n",
    "- Analysing the **performance** of algorithms and data structures\n",
    "- Benchmarking: how to measure performance (sensibly)\n",
    "- Relations between theory and (hardware) reality\n",
    "- Really hard problems (if there are any)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **well-defined computational procedure**\n",
    "- Takes **input**\n",
    "- Transforms it to **output**\n",
    "- It thus **solves** a **computational problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Sorting problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: A sequence of $n$ numbers $\\langle a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n\\rangle$\n",
    "- **Output**: A permutation $\\langle a'_1, a'_2, \\dots, a'_n\\rangle$ of the input sequence such that $a'_1\\leq a'_2\\leq \\dots\\leq a'_n$\n",
    "- Sample problem **instance**\n",
    "    - Input: $\\langle 31, 59, 41, 26 \\rangle$\n",
    "    - Output: $\\langle 26, 31, 41, 59 \\rangle$\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Typical questions\n",
    "- How can we solve the sorting problem by computer?\n",
    "- When can we apply the sorting method?\n",
    "- Correctness\n",
    "    - Can we be sure that no data gets lost?\n",
    "    - Can we be sure that algorithm will always **terminate**?\n",
    "    - Can we be sure that data is properly sorted?\n",
    "- Performance\n",
    "    - How long does it take?\n",
    "    - What if $n$ doubles, increase 10-, 1000-, million-fold?\n",
    "    - What if data is, e.g., sorted before we start?\n",
    "    - How much memory will be required?\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### In-class problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can you think of data that can not be sorted (without additional information)?"

    "\n",
    "- Any array with the following properties\n",
    "    - The array is *mutable*, i.e., the algorithm can change elements in the array and this change will be visible to the caller of the algorithm when it completes (counterexample: Python `tuple`)\n",

    "    - **Termination:** When the loop terminates, the invariant provides information about the state of the data which helps us to show that the algorithm is correct (did the right thing)\n",

    "##### Invariant\n",
    "At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 2–8, the subarray `A[1..j-1]` consists of the elements originally in `A[1..j-1]`, but in sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Initialization\n",
    "- Before first iteration: `j == 2`\n",
    "- Therefore `A[1..j-1]` is `A[1..1]`, i.e., `A[1]`\n",
    "- We have not changed anything in `A` yet, so `A[1]` contains the same elements as it contained originally\n",
    "- Since `A[1]` contains only a single element, it is in sorted order\n",
    "- Thus, the invariant holds before the first iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Maintenance\n",
    "- We assume that the invariant holds for `j == J`, i.e., that `A[1..J-1]` contains the elements originally in `A[1..J-1]` in sorted order\n",
    "- We now execute the for loop for `j == J`\n",
    "- We need to show that afterwards, `A[1..J]` contains the elements originally in `A[1..J]` in sorted order\n",
    "- Proof\n",
    "    1. On line 3, we store `A[J]` in `key`\n",
    "    2. On line 4, we initialize `i = j-1 = J-1`\n",
    "    3. The while-loop on lines 5–7 moves elements to the right\n",
    "        - It only moves elements one position to the right\n",
    "        - The rightmost element that is assigned a new value is element `A[J]` (for `i == J-1`)\n",
    "        - The order of elements is not changed\n",
    "        - The while-loop stops either\n",
    "            - if we have copied all elements (`i == 0`) and\n",
    "                - `A[2..J]` now contains the same elements that were in `A[1..J-1]` before we entered the while loop and we know that all ofh them are larger than `key`\n",
    "                - We store `key` into `A[i+1]`, i.e., `A[1]` on line 8\n",
    "            - or if the element at `i` is not larger than `key` and\n",
    "                - `A[i+2..J]` now contains the same elements that were previously in `A[i+1..J-1]` and these are all larger than `key`\n",
    "                - `A[1..i]` is unchanged from the previous iteration, i.e., sorted, and its largest element `A[i]` is not larger than `key`\n",
    "                - We store `key` into `A[i+1]` on line 8\n",
    "    5. Thus:\n",
    "        - All elements in `A[1..i]` are sorted (by assumption) and are not larger than `key`. This holds because we did not touch them in the while loop.\n",
    "        - All the elements in `A[i+2..J]` \n",
    "            - are larger than `key`\n",
    "            - are the same as previously in `A[i+1..J-1]`\n",
    "            - are sorted (by assumption, because we move every element that we touch in the while loop one position to the right)\n",
    "        - Since we know that `A[i] ≤ key < A[i+2]` and `A[i+1] == key`, we know that the elements in `A[1..J]` are the same as before and sorted\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Termination\n",
    "- Let `n == A.length` be the number of keys to be sorted\n",
    "- After the last iteration, we have `j == n+1`\n",
    "- Thus, the invariant reads: At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 2–8, the subarray `A[1..n]` consists of the elements originally in `A[1..n]`, but in sorted order.\n",
